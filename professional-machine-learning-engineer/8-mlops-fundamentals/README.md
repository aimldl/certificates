# MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) Fundamentals

# About

- MLOps is a discipline focused on 
  - the deployment, 
  - testing, 
  - monitoring, and 
  - automation of ML systems in production. 
- Participants to MLOps tools
- Best practices for deploying, evaluating, monitoring and operating production ML systems on Google Cloud. 
  - Use tools for continuous improvement and evaluation of deployed models. 
-  Machine Learning Engineering professionals
  - work with Data Scientists, 
    - who develop models, to enable velocity and rigor in deploying the best performing models.
