- https://www.coursera.org/learn/mlops-fundamentals/gradedLti/vzq1K/qwiklabs-continuous-training-pipeline-with-kubeflow-pipeline-and-cloud-ai

## Purpose

- Build, deploy, and run a Kubeflow Pipeline (KFP) 
  - that orchestrates BigQuery and AI Platform services 
    - to train, tune, and deploy a scikit-learn model

## Learning objectives

- Use Kubeflow **pre-build components**
  - BiqQuery
  - AI Platform
    - training and predictions
- Use Kubeflow **lightweight python components**
- Build a Kubeflow pipeline with these components
- Compile, upload, and run a KF pipeline with the command line
