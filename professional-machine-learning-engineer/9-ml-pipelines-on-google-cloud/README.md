# About

- Learn from ML Engineers and Trainers 
  - who work with the state-of-the-art development of ML pipelines at Google Cloud.  

- TensorFlow Extended (or TFX)
  - Googleâ€™s production machine learning platform based on TensorFlow 
    - for management of ML pipelines and metadata. 
  - Learn about pipeline components and pipeline orchestration with TFX. 
- Learn how you can automate your pipeline 
  - through continuous integration and continuous deployment,
  - and how to manage ML metadata.

- Discuss how we can automate and reuse ML pipelines 
  - across multiple ML frameworks 
    - such as tensorflow, pytorch, scikit learn, and xgboost.  
- Cloud Composer
  - to orchestrate your continuous training pipelines.
- Go over how to use MLflow for managing the complete machine learning life cycle.
