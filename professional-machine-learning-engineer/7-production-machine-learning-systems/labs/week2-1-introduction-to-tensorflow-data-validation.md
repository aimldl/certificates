# Lab:  Introduction to TensorFlow data validation

## Purpose

Understanding the features of

- TensorFlow Extended > TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)
  - useful for 
    - comparing multiple datasets (e.g., training vs inference datasets)
    - and reporting

Compare datasets

- based on the Google PAIR Facets project.

## Objectives

- Review TFDV methods
- Generate statistics
- Visualize statistics
- Infer a schema
- Update a schema

## Steps to prepare the hands-on lab

1. Setup and requirements
2. Clone course repo within your Vertex AI notebooks instance
3. Open the notebook
4. Do the hands-on lab

## About TFDV

TFDV offers visualization capabilities which helps 

- understand
- validate
- monitor your data.

TFDV can be used for 

- generating schemas 
- statistics about the distribution of every feature in the dataset. 

## Hands-on lab

Go to Google docs > [Lab: Introduction to TensorFlow data validation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5mDHV2LP7pAuLh_OBZQSJiUntexCb9xVdKdJ2PbAO8/edit#heading=h.eg0a9rka5ueb)

My mirror files

- ipynb_files/

- - [tfdv_basic_spending.ipynb](ipynb_files/tfdv_basic_spending.ipynb)

  - - Output all cleaned

  - [tfdv_basic_spending-1.ipynb](ipynb_files/tfdv_basic_spending-1.ipynb)

    - The package dependency issue failed the installation of TFDV.
    - I tried both TF2.10 and TF.2.6 and both of them failed.
    - TODO: Do the following as instructed in the notebook and re-do it.

```
Restart the kernel (Kernel > Restart kernel > Restart).
Re-run the above cell and proceed further.
Note: Please ignore any incompatibility warnings and errors.
```
