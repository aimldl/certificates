# Lab: Serving ML predictions in batch and realtime

- 2 hours
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-production-ml-systems/gradedLti/rYbwM/lab-serving-ml-predictions-in-batch-and-realtime

## Purpose

Run Dataflow pipelines 

- to serve predictions for 
  - batch requests
  - streaming in real time


## Objectives

- Create a prediction service 
  - that calls your trained model deployed in Cloud to serve predictions.

- Run a Dataflow job 
  - to have the prediction service 
    - read in batches from a CSV file and serve predictions.

- Run a streaming Dataflow pipeline 
  - to read requests in real time 
    - from Pub/Sub 

  - write predictions 
    - into a BigQuery table.


## Tasks

1. Setup and requirements
2. Clone course repo within your Vertex AI notebooks instance
3. Check project permissions
4. Run the notebook to copy and trained the Vertex AI Platform model
