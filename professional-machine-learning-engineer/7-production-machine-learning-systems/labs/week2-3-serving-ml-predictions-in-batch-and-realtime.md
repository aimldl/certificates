# Lab: Serving ML predictions in batch and realtime

- 2 hours
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/gcp-production-ml-systems/gradedLti/rYbwM/lab-serving-ml-predictions-in-batch-and-realtime

## Purpose

Run Dataflow pipelines 

- to serve predictions for 
  - batch requests
  - streaming in real time


## Objectives

- Create a prediction service 
  - that calls your trained model deployed in Cloud to serve predictions.

- Run a Dataflow job 
  - to have the prediction service 
    - read in batches from a CSV file and serve predictions.

- Run a streaming Dataflow pipeline 
  - to read requests in real time 
    - from Pub/Sub 

  - write predictions 
    - into a BigQuery table.


## Steps to prepare the hands-on lab
