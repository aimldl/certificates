# Quiz: Understanding the ML Enterprise Workflow

**Your grade: 100%**

Question 1

Which two activities are involved in **ML development**?
```
Q: Can I define and explain training operationalization to others?
```

- [ ] Training formalization and **training operationalization**

- [ ] Version control and training operationalization

- [ ] Experimentation and version control

- [x] Experimentation and **training operationalization**


Question 2

Which process covers algorithm selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation in **the Experimentation and Prototyping activity**?


- [ ] Data exploration

- [x] Model prototyping

- [ ] Model validation

- [ ] Feature engineering


Question 3

What is the correct process that data scientists use to develop the models on **an experimentation platform**?
```
Data selection vs. Data exploration
- Data selection
  - Does it mean data preparation?
  - Or it means the real rough process to decide what dataset will be used?
```

- [ ] Problem definition > Data exploration > Data selection > Feature engineering > Model prototyping > Model validation

- [x] Problem definition > Data selection > Data exploration > Feature engineering > Model prototyping > Model validation (guess)

- [ ] Problem definition > Data selection > Data exploration > Model prototyping > Feature engineering > Model validation

- [ ] Problem definition > Data selection > Data exploration > Model prototyping > Model validation > Feature engineering


Question 4

If the model needs to be repeatedly retrained in the future, an automated training pipeline is also developed. Which task do we use for this?

- [ ] Training formalization

- [ ] Training implementation

- [x] Training operationalization

- [ ] Experimentation & prototyping
