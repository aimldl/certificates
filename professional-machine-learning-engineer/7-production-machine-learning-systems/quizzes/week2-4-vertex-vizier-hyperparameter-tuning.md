# Quiz: Vertex Vizier Hyperparameter Tuning

**Grade: 100%**

Question 1

**Bayesian optimization** takes into account past evaluations when choosing the hyperparameter set to evaluate next. By **choosing its parameter combinations in an informed way**, it enables itself to focus on those areas of the parameter space that it believes will bring the most promising validation scores. Therefore it _____________________.
