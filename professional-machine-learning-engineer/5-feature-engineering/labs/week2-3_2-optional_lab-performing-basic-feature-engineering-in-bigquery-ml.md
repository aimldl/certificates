# (Optional) Lab: Advanced Feature Engineering BigQuery ML

Equivalently

- Performing Advanced Feature Engineering in BQML.
- Advanced Feature Engineering in BQML

## Learning objectives

1. Evaluate the model
2. **Extract temporal features, feature cross temporal features**
3. **Apply ML.FEATURE_CROSS to categorical features**
4. **Create a Euclidian feature column, feature cross coordinate features**
5. **Apply the BUCKETIZE function, TRANSFORM clause, L2 Regularization**

- I've added some additional comments in the following lines.
- Each learning objective will correspond to a #TODO in the student lab notebook

```
This lab creates up to model_7 and final_model. 
```

**Up to model_3, the lab is identical to the basic feature engineering in the previous lab!**

To-do: I finished reading the code for the rest of the lab. Finish doing the actual lab when I have more free time.
