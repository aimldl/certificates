    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "1. Preprocess data and engineer new features using TfTransform. \n",
    "1. Create and deploy Apache Beam pipeline. \n",

    "## Introduction \n",
    "While Pandas is fine for experimenting, for operationalization of your workflow it is better to do preprocessing in Apache Beam. This will also help if you need to preprocess data in flight, since Apache Beam allows for streaming. In this lab we will pull data from BigQuery then use Apache Beam  TfTransform to process the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Only specific combinations of TensorFlow/Beam are supported by tf.transform so make sure to get a combo that works. In this lab we will be using: \n",
    "* TFT 0.24.0\n",
    "* TF 2.3.0 \n",
    "* Apache Beam [GCP] 2.24.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in the notebook where you will complete the notebook cell's code before running. Refer to the [solution notebook](../solutions/5_tftransform_taxifare.ipynb) for reference. \n"
