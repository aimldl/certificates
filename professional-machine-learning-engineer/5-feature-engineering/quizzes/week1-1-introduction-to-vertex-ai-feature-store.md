# Quiz: Introduction to Vertex AI Feature Store

Question 1. What is one definition of a feature in machine learning?

- A value that you receive from a model as an output
- A method of feature store
- **A value that is passed as input to a model**
- A place to store any data

Question 2. Vertex AI Feature Store provides a centralized repository for organizing, storing, and serving ML features. Using a central feature store enables an organization to efficiently share, discover, and re-use ML features at scale, which can increase the velocity of developing and deploying new ML applications. What are the key challenges that Vertex AI Feature Store solves?

- Mitigate data storage silos, which occurs when you might have built and managed separate solutions for storage and the consumption of feature values.
- Detect drift, as a result of significant changes to your feature data distribution over time. 
- Mitigate training-serving skew, which occurs when the feature data distribution that you use in production differs from the feature data distribution that was used to train your model.
- **All of the options are correct.**

Question 3 Where are the features registered?

- **Feature registry** (my guess)
- Online Store
- Offline Store
- Feature Monitoring

Question 4 Which of the following is an instance of an entity type?

- Feature 
- Online Store
- **Entity**
- Feature store

Question 5 What are the two methods feature store offers for serving features?

- Online serving and Offline serving
- **Batch serving and Online serving**
- Offline serving and Stream serving
- Batch serving and Stream serving

Question 6 Which of the following is the process of importing feature values computed by your feature engineering jobs into a feature store?

- Feature store
- Feature Monitoring
- Feature serving
- **Feature ingestion**
