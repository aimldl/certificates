- 
  task.json, model.json

- 
  task.avro, model.avro

- 
  task.xml, model.xml

Q2. Which file is the entry point to your code that Vertex AI will start and contains details such as â€œhow to parse command-line arguments and where to write model outputs?

- model.py

- 
  tmodel.json

- 
  tmodel.avro
