Grade: 50%

Question 1

What does tf.Transform do during the training and serving phase?

- Provides a transformation polynomial to train the data

- 
  None of the options are correct.

- 
  Provides computation over the entire dataset, including on both internal and external data sources

- **Provides a TensorFlow graph for preprocessing**



Question 2
What is Tensorflow Transform a hybrid of?

- **Apache and TensorFlow** 
- 
  Dataflow and Tensorflow

- Both options are correct. (wrong guess)
- 
  None of the options are correct.


Question 3
True or False: One of the goals of tf.Transform is to provide a TensorFlow graph for preprocessing that can be incorporated into the serving graph (and, optionally, the training graph).

**True**


False

Question 4
Fill in the blank: 

The __ _ is the most important concept of tf.Transform. The  _ is a logical description of a transformation of the dataset. The  ___ accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors, where a tensor means Tensor or 2D SparseTensor. 

- Preprocessing method (wrong guess)
- **Preprocessing function**
- 
  Preprocessing variable
