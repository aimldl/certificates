# Quiz: Raw Data to Features

Question 1
In what form can raw data be used inside ML models?

- **After turning your raw data into a useful feature vectors**
- 
  After turning your raw data into a useful feature matrix

- 
  After turning your raw data into multidimensional vectors

- 
  None of the options are correct.


Question 2
A good feature has which of the following characteristics?

- It should be related to the objective.

- 
  It should be known at prediction time.

- 
  It should be numeric with meaningful magnitude.

- **All of the options are correct.**

Question 3
Which of the following are the requirements to build an effective machine learning model?

- It should scale to a large dataset.

- It should find good features. (wrong guess)
- 
  It should be able to preprocess with Vertex AI Platform.

- **All of the options are correct.

```
I don't quite agree with the 3rd option. Vertex AI Platform is not the only option to build an effective model. But the answer is 4 anyways.
```

Question 4
Which of the following statements is true about preprocessing?

- **Preprocessing within the context of Cloud ML allows you to do it at scale.** (guess)
- 
  Preprocessing without the context of Cloud ML allows you to do it at scale.

- 
  Both options are correct.

- 
  None of the options are correct.


Question 5
Which of the following statements is true?

- Same problems in the same domain may need different features.

- **Different problems in the same domain may need different features.**
- 
  Different problems in different domains may need the same features.

- 
  None of the options are correct.
