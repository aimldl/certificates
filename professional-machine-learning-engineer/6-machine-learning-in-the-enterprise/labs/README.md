# Labs

## Clone course repo within your Vertex AI Notebooks instance

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
```

### Hands-on

1. Go to [training-data-analyst > courses > machine_learning > deepdive2 > **introduction_to_tensorflow > labs**](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/introduction_to_tensorflow/labs)
2. Open the .`ipynb file` for each lab, e.g. `3_keras_sequential_api.ipynb`
3. The solution is available at [training-data-analyst > courses > machine_learning > deepdive2 > **introduction_to_tensorflow > solutions**](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/introduction_to_tensorflow/solutions)

## To-do

Not all the work for the labs is stored here. I may redo the missing labs and stored them here for completeness.
